   - Ensure it is fully built using the steps above.

2. **Open Command Prompt**:
   - Open "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022" or "Qt MinGW" command prompt.

3. **Navigate to the Build Directory:**
   - Use the command prompt to navigate to the directory where your applicationâ€™s executable is located:
     ```bash
     cd .../tetris/build/release
     ```

4. **Run `windeployqt`:**
   - Run the following command to deploy your application:
     ```bash
     windeployqt tetris.exe
